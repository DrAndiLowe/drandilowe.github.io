## Overview

- This talk will present a walk-through of the development of a prototype machine learning classifier for differentiating between quark and gluon jets at experiments like those at the LHC.
- A new fast feature selection method that combines information theory and graph analytics will be outlined. This method has found new variables that promise significant improvements in discrimination power.
- The prototype jet tagger is simple, interpretable, parsimonious, and computationally extremely cheap, and therefore might be suitable for use in trigger systems for real-time
data processing.
- The data analysis was performed entirely in the R statistical programming language, and is fully reproducible. The entire analysis workflow is data-driven, automated and runs on very modest hardware with no human intervention.

## The problem in a nutshell

- Beams of energetic protons collide inside our detector
- Quarks and gluons emerge and decay into sprays of particles
- Algorithms cluster these decay products into jets
- For each jet, we'd like to know what initiated it:
    - *Was it a quark or a gluon?*
- Being able to accurately discriminate between quark- and gluon-initiated jets would be an extremely powerful tool in the search for new particles and new physics
- This is an archetypal classification problem that might be amenable to machine learning

## What is machine learning?

- Arthur Samuel (1959): Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn
without being explicitly programmed
- Tom Mitchell (1998): A computer program is said to learn from experience *E* with respect to some task *T* and some performance measure *P*, if its performance on *T*, as measured by *P*, improves with experience *E*
- Traditional programming versus machine learning:

```{r fig.align='center', fig.height=3, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
require(png)
require(grid)
img <- readPNG("boxes.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

## Machine learning & HEP

* Machine learning is more or less what is commonly known in particle physics as multivariate analysis (MVA)
* Used for many years but faced widespread scepticism
* Use of multivariate pattern recognition algorithms was basically taboo in new particle searches until recently
* Much prejudice against using what were considered "black box" selection algorithms
* Artificial neural networks and Fisher discriminants (linear discriminant analysis) were used somewhat in the 1990's
* Boosted Decision Tree (AdaBoost, 1996) is the favourite algorithm used for many analyses (1st use: 2004)

## What is the goal of this work?

We want a simple, interpretable, parsimonious, preferably computationally cheap model that is informative and actually stands a reasonable chance of being deployed at some point in the future. We would also like to spend our limited CPU cycles on robust testing, rather than a complex model.

(This is not a Kaggle competition! Of course we care about model performance, but there are other important considerations.)

## Data production pipeline

* Generate Monte Carlo simulated data with lots of jets
    - *pp* at 7 TeV, Pythia 6
    - Jets reconstructed using FastJet, Anti-*k*á´› with a radial parameter of 0.4, and these serve as our "detector-level" objects
* Use my C++ code to fill ROOT ntuples with engineered features
* Attach ground-truth class labels ("quark"/"gluon") to each jet
    - Significant class noise (mislabelled jets) at the 5--10% level
    - Procedure sometimes fails to assign class (missing labels)
    - Several labelling schemes exist, but none are perfect because Monte Carlo simulation cannot perfectly simulate real data
* Write-out data and convert for use in **R**

## Feature engineering

- Quick and easy to generate new variables, following example in$^*$:
- The procedure is:
      - Pick a particle
      - Pick a kinematic property
      - Pick a second particle
      - Optionally transform to a boosted frame
      - *etc.*
- This recipe results in a proliferation of many unintuitive combinations of variables
- *Many variables found during a very thorough literature search*
- Hundreds of experimentally motivated, physically motivated, and unmotivated single-variable discriminants

## What is R?

- An open source programming language for statistical computing
- R is a dialect of the S language
- S is a language that was developed by John Chambers and others at Bell Labs
- S was initiated in 1976 as an internal statistical analysis environment --- originally implemented as FORTRAN libraries
- Rewritten in C in 1988
- S continues to this day as part of the GNU free software project
- R created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in 1991
- First announcement of R to the public in 1993
- GNU General Public License makes R free software in 1995
- Version 1.0.0 release in 2000

## Why use R?

- Free and runs on almost any standard computing platform/OS
- Frequent releases; active development
- Very active and vibrant user community
    - Estimated ~2 million users worldwide
    - R-help and R-devel mailing lists, Stack Overflow
    - Frequent conferences; useR!, EARL, etc.
    - 388 Meetup groups worldwide
- Big-name backing: Microsoft, Google, IBM, Oracle, ...
- Functionality is divided into modular packages
    - Download and install just what you need
    - There are now > 10000 packages on CRAN
- Graphics capabilities are very sophisticated
- Useful for interactive work, but contains a powerful programming language for developing new tools 

## Any other reasons for using R?

- R enables fast prototyping and high-level abstractions that let you concentrate on what you want to achieve, rather than on the mechanics of how you might do it
    - Enables you to stay "in the flow" of data analysis
- Latest machine learning algorithms are available
- Many technical questions have probably already been answered on Stack Overflow
- R offers a pleasant user experience

**R allows you to concentrate on your data, not on your tools**

## Truth labelling assumptions

- Assume as "ground truth" that light jets have a discrete flavour
- Furthermore, we assume that we have a method that can assign a partonic flavour label with high efficiency
- However, such methods are not unambiguous and are not strictly identical for different MC generators
- Definitions are not theoretically robust, but studies (with MADGRAPH) have shown that for most generators, truth labelling using the highest-energy parton that points to the jet is identical to matrix-element-based labelling for 90-95% of (isolated) jets
- We would like to have more confidence in the assigned truth labels, so we use an ensemble method to filter the training data

## Jet labelling by ensemble

- Jets labelled using the partons in the generator event record
- Used an ensemble labelling scheme with 5 members:
- Use flavour of parton with highest transverse momentum...
    1. within radius equal to radius parameter of the jet algorithm; this is identical to the scheme used by ATLAS*
    2. ghost-associated with jet during clustering
- QCD-aware jet labelling: cluster *final* partons into jet, only allowing clustering steps that obey QCD and QED Feynman rules, then label particle jet with parton jet...
    3. within radius equal to radius parameter of the jet algorithm
    4. ghost-associated with jet during clustering
    5. *k*á´›-based reclustering of final partons to anti-*k*á´› particle jets

## Relationship between different labelling schemes

- We can explore how the labelling schemes differ by examining tables that are essentially adjacency matrices for each pair of schemes
- Instead of trying to scrutinise several tables of numbers, we instead plot the pairwise relationships for all five schemes using a chord diagram, which is a compact way to represent the data
- Next: all pairings, and pairings with mismatched labels


## {data-background="chord-all-1.png" data-background-size="contain" data-background-color=#ffffff}

## {data-background="chord-mismatching-1.png" data-background-size="contain" data-background-color=#ffffff}

## Relationship between different labelling schemes

- There is good agreement in general, but we observe that the "max-$p_\mathrm{T}$" schemes tend to label more jets as photon-initiated, that would otherwise be labelled by the QCD-aware schemes as gluon-initiated or having no label assigned
- A similar pattern of behaviour was reported in *QCD-aware partonic jet clustering for truth-jet flavour labelling*, Buckley, A. & Pollard, C. Eur. Phys. J. C (2016) 76: 71

## Jet filtering

- Impose a requirement that the jets are isolated to restrict contamination from wide-angle QCD radiation
    - For each jet, require no other jet within 2.5 times the jet radial parameter of the jet axis (we did this already for the chord diagrams on the previous slides)
- Discard jets for which no label could be assigned
- Discard heavy-flavour jets; they are not the subject of this analysis
* Single-track jets are removed; it is not possible to construct a meaningful observable for these jets (we need substructure)
- Reject jets for which there is not concensus between label schemes
- To track *intercoder agreement*, we use Krippendorff's Î±
    - Works in the presence of missing data
    - 0 = no agreement, 1 = perfect agreement; our data: 0.8

## Jet filtering justification

- It is axiomatic that the performance of any discrimination algorithm will be measured with respect to its ability to predict the ground-truth class labels (the jet partonic flavour)
- If we had perfect understanding of the dynamics of QCD, we could deduce the *Bayes optimal decision boundary* that best separates quark- and gluon-initiated jets
- We attempt to use machine learning to learn an approximation to the Bayes decision boundary
- *Label noise* (mislabelled jets) blurs and obfuscates this decision boundary, which can thwart a machine learning classifier
- Rather than engineer a more complex classifier, we instead engineer our *training data* to more clearly expose the structure in it

## Data exploration

* Missingness and floating-point types
* Variation in magnitude
* Correlations and partial correlations

## {data-background="missingness-1.png" data-background-size="contain" data-background-color=#ffffff}

## Missingness and categorisation of data values

* Data stratified by number of tracks per jet
* Instances for which no physically-meaningful value can be assigned
    - These are *missing not at random* (MNAR): missing observations related to values of
unobserved data
* Many small values below machine Îµ that are due to round-off error in floating point arithmatic
    - Variation in their values is not real; reset these values to zero
    - Small values can incur a performance penalty during floating point arithmatic; flushing to zero might speed-up training
* Filter features with >50% missing or zero values
* Filter features with few unique values (low variance)
* Next: magnitude map


## {data-background="heatmap-1.png" data-background-size="contain" data-background-color=#ffffff}

## Magnitude map

- Initially there is huge variation in magnitude among the features
- Applied Z-score standardisation so that features have mean 0 and standard deviation 1
- Additionally, applied Yeo-Johnson power transformations to make features with long-tailed distributions more Gaussian
- Examine correlations next (and discover that correlograms are rather poor visualisations for this data)

## {data-background="correlogram-top-1.png" data-background-size="contain" data-background-color=#ffffff}

## {data-background="qgraph-pearson-cor-1.png" data-background-size="contain" data-background-color=#ffffff}

## {data-background="qgraph-pearson-glasso-1.png" data-background-size="contain" data-background-color=#ffffff}

## {data-background="qgraph-pearson-glasso-cut-1.png" data-background-size="contain" data-background-color=#ffffff}

## Fast feature selection

* We want to find the variables that best explain the differences in physics between quark-jets and gluon-jets
* Typical methods for feature selection too slow
* Ranked features using an entropy-based method
* Filter-based method that involves ranking by *information gain* (Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence)
    - Information gain is based on the concept of entropy from information theory and is commonly used to decide which features to use when growing a decision tree
* To test method: inject random probes ("BOGUS" features) into the data, repeatedly calculate information gain for a large number of bootstrap resamplings, obtain means and confidence interval estimates

## {data-background="plot-infogain-topXpc-1.png" data-background-size="contain" data-background-color=#ffffff}

## Removing redundant features using mutual information

- Information gain does not separate redundant features
- To filter redundant features, I used *mutual information*
    * In information theory, the mutual information (MI) of two random variables is a measure of their mutual dependence
    * Quantifies the "amount of information" obtained about one random variable, through the other random variable
    * Used *symmetric uncertainty*, a normalized variant that we can treat like a correlation

The area contained by both circles is the joint entropy H(X,Y). The circle on the left (red and violet) is the individual *Shannon entropy* H(X). The circle on the right (blue and violet) is H(Y). The violet is the **mutual information** I(X;Y).", cache=TRUE}

```

## Mutual information

Formally, the mutual information of two discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$ can be defined as:

\begin{equation}
I\left(X;Y\right) = \sum\limits_{y \in Y}\sum\limits_{x \in X} p\left(x,y\right) \log_{2}\left(\frac{p\left(x,y\right)}{p\left(x\right) p\left(y\right)}\right)
\end{equation}

where $p(x,y)$ is the joint PDF of $X$ and $Y$, and $p(x)$ and $p(y)$ are the marginal PDFs of $X$ and $Y$ respectively. 

In the case of continuous random variables, the summation is replaced by a definite double integral:

\begin{equation}
I\left(X;Y\right) = \int_{Y}\int_{X} p\left(x,y\right) \log_{2}\left(\frac{p\left(x,y\right)}{p\left(x\right) p\left(y\right)}\right) dx dy
\end{equation}

where $p(x,y)$ is now the joint PDF of $X$ and $Y$, and $p(x)$ and $p(y)$ are the marginal PDFs of $X$ and $Y$.

## Relation to other quantities

Mutual information can be equivalently expressed as:

\begin{equation}
I(X;Y) = H(X) + H(Y) - H(X,Y)
\end{equation}

where $H(X)$ and $H(Y)$ are the marginal Shannon entropies of $X$ and $Y$ respectively:

\begin{equation}
H\left(X\right) = -\sum\limits_{x \in X} p(x) \log_{2} p(x)
\end{equation}

and $H(X,Y)$ is the joint entropy of $X$ and $Y$:

\begin{equation}
H\left(X,Y\right) = -\sum\limits_{y \in Y}\sum\limits_{x \in X} p(x,y) \log_{2} p(x,y)
\end{equation}

## Symmetric uncertainty

The following is a normalized variant of the mutual information:

\begin{equation}
U\left(X,Y\right) = 2\frac{I(X;Y)}{H(X) + H(Y)}
\end{equation}

The mutual information is estimated from the data using frequency counts in histogram bins.

<small>
There are several strategies for doing this. The simplest estimator is the empirical (or "naive") MI estimator that gives the maximum-likelihood entropy estimate for a discretised random variable. It is known that this is a biased estimator due to undersampling of the cell frequencies with increasing number of bins. We found the Miller-Madow asymptotic bias-corrected estimator to be most suitable for our needs, and it is simpler than the shrinkage or SchÃ¼rmann-Grassberger estimators that uses the Dirichlet probability distribution as conjugate prior for the likelihood given by the empirical estimator.

## Feature redundancy

* We'd like to pick features that have a strong association with the target ("quark"/"gluon") but have weak association with each other

```{r venn, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.height=4, fig.cap="<small>If Z is the target, for each X and Y measure the total *conditional mutual information* corresponding to the cyan and magenta regions. If the sum is large (and the grey region is small) then this is a good pairing. Note that the grey region (the *multivariate mutual information*) may be negative, meaning that a pair of features may synergise.</small>", cache=TRUE}

## Conditional mutual information

Conditional mutual information written in terms of joint and marginal Shannon entropies:

\begin{equation}
I(X;Y|Z) = H(X,Z) + H(Y,Z) - H(X,Y,Z) - H(Z)
\end{equation}

or, in terms of mutual information:

\begin{equation}
I(X;Y|Z) = I(X;Y,Z) - I(X;Z)
\end{equation}

## {data-background="biplot.png" data-background-size="contain" data-background-color=#ffffff}

## Model

- Our baseline model is ElasticNet, a generalised linear model that combines the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ penalties of the LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) and ridge methods:
    - $\ell_1$ is a LASSO penalty
    - $\ell_2$ is a ridge penalty, aka Tikhonov regularisation
- It's basically logistic regression and fit via penalized maximum likelihood with the result that the coefficients shrink and can become zero, resulting in a sparse model
- Nested stratified k-fold cross validation was used to generate robust estimates of model performance:
    - The outer CV is used to estimate model performance; 5 folds
    - The inner CV is used for hyperparameter ($\alpha$, $\lambda$) tuning and model selection; 5 folds
- Created a custom metric to tune the probability threshold for a quark-tagging efficiency of 50%

## Logistic regression

Uses the function:

$$
P(X) = \frac{e^{\theta_0 + \theta_1{x_1} + \cdots + \theta_p{x_p}}}{1+e^{\theta_0 + \theta_1{x_1} + \cdots + \theta_p{x_p}}}
$$

A bit of rearrangement gives:

$$
\log\left(\frac{P(X)}{1-P(X)}\right) = \theta_0 + \theta_1{x_1} + \cdots + \theta_p{x_p} = \Theta^T{X}
$$

This transformation is called the *log odds* or *logit* of $P(X)$.

We want to find the values of the coefficients $\Theta$.

In ElasticNet, we contrain the size of coefficients by adding a combination of penalty functions based on $\|\Theta\|_1$ and $\|\Theta\|_2$.

## Coefficient shrinkage

## Results

- At our chosen working point, a quark tagging efficiency of 50%, the gluon mistag rate is estimated to be 26%
- This is not bad for a simple linear model!
- The whole model can be summarised in a handful of coefficients: the means and standard deviations used to standardise the features, the Yeo-Johnson $\lambda$s used to make the feature distributions Gaussian-like, and the $\beta$s of the ElasticNet model
- Did not use PCA/ICA for the sake of interpretability
- We tried other classes of model, but none had better performance
    - ANN, BDT (AdaBoost & Real AdaBoost), GBM, SVM (various kernels), kNN, Random Forest, Rotation Forest...
- Models using boosting were consistently bad: class noise hurts!
- We found some good engineered features, but we conjecture the next leap in performance will come from neural nets that can learn their own features

## What is the best feature?

- Answer: there is no silver bullet; the performance of features appears to be dependent on upstream cuts and (we conjecture) other details of the experimental setup (*e.g.*, jet algorithm radial parameter, whether any jet topiary was performed)
- We explored feature importance, using information gain, as a function of the number of tracks per jet, and the minimum number of tracks per jet
    - We required that there are at least two tracks in a jet
    - If we increase this number, we would reject more jets, but might this be a compromise worth making? *Look in the long tail?*
- Next, we show that increasing the minimum number of tracks ought to lead to increased quark/gluon discrimination power for those jets that remain after this cut, but the relationship is not monotonic --- we conjecture that jet grooming might be useful
- Room for improvement?

## Reproducible research

- The paper (in preparation) is written in R Markdown, a LaTeX-like authoring format that combines the core syntax of Markdown (an easy to write plain-text format) with embedded R code chunks that are run so their output can be included in the final document
- The markup for the paper contains the entire analysis code used to generate the LaTeX, tables, and plots
- Greater transparency: no need for "forensic HEP" to figure out how the results were derived from the data! 
- The pay-off in the (not so) long run is that reuse allows for de-duplication of effort
- Other researchers (you!) can easily build upon reproducible analyses to create new work or perform secondary analyses
- We should do more of this!

## Some key messages to take away

- Perhaps the world's first complete HEP analysis in R
- Pioneered new method for variable ranking and selection
- Many features explored, but many are not independent
- The model is simple and computationally cheap
    - Better performance might come from using neural networks, which can learn their own internal representation of the data from low-level features; we're probably hitting the limit of what can be done with physically-motivated engineered features
- Indications that some form of jet grooming might be useful
- We employed a robust validation method to obtain credible performance estimates
- Reproducibility is a first-class citizen in this analysis; we adopt a workflow that incorporates reproducibility from the outset
- Reproducible research not getting much attention in HEP -- it's a good time to contribute!
